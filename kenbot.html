    <s2>About Kenbot</s2>

    <hr>


    <p>Kenbot is a game that guesses who the user is thinking of based on their
    responses to a series of questions. This project is very special to me
    because it was my first coding project, and I worked on it during the
    summer before my freshman year at UC San Diego. My partner and I wrote and
    tested all the code in less than two weeks, with a limited knowledge of
    Python, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and programming concepts as a whole. If you want
    to try the game out without reading this entire writeup, <a href=

    <s2>Technologies Used</s2>

    <hr>


    <p>Frontend: HTML, CSS, jQuery | Backend: Python | Hosting: Heroku,
    Flask<br>
    <br>
    As a team, we mostly split up the work between front-end and back-end, but
    collaborated on both ends to develop Kenbot together. I was responsible for
    most of the front-end and design work on the application. We chose to use
    Python to implement the back-end because that was the (only) language we
    were most familiar with! Additionally, I had some experience in making
    Neopets pages with HTML and CSS while growing up, so I was able to throw
    together a (hopefully) aesthetically pleasing template for the game.<br>
    <br>
    Although some of the project was smooth sailing, we definitely ran into
    some challenges. The most challenging technology that I used was jQuery. We
    decided to focus on the user experience, and that we wanted the website to
    have smooth animations, so figuring out how to make the pages fade-in and
    how to properly time the transitions was a fun challenge. We used Flask to
    host Kenbot as an application on Heroku, so it's open to the public to play
    around with!</p>

    <s2>Process</s2>

    <hr>


    <p>In order to create the application, we had to survey students so that we
    could use them as options in the game. After conducting a survey of student
    attributes, we created a spreadsheet that allowed each student to have a
    unique combination of answers to the ten questions we chose. We used Python
    to parse through this CSV data, and also to match players' answers to the
    correct person that they were thinking of. When the program is confident
    that it has identified the right answer, it returns that answer to the
    player and outputs it on the screen!<br>
    <br>
    We presented the completed project to other students and professors, and
    the general reception was great. It was amazing to see that others were
    impressed by our work, and the constructive criticism and advice we
    received was very helpful towards improving the overall application.</p>

    <s2>Takeaways</s2>

    <hr>


    <p>The key takeaway I had from working on Kenbot was that I could create
    anything, as long as I put in the work to learn how to do it. Coming into
    this project, I had basically no programming experience. It took countless
    hours of frustration, dozens of HTML/CSS tutorials, and hundreds of Stack
    Overflow queries for us to produce Kenbot. However, creating Kenbot helped
    us start our CS careers with the understanding that anything is possible,
    if you work hard enough and use your resources wisely.<br>
